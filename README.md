**Deepfake & Image Forgery Detection**  

A CNN-based system to detect and localize image forgeries—including AI-generated manipulations like DeepFakes—using Grad-CAM for visual explainability. This project aims to assist digital forensics by highlighting tampered regions in images and enhancing model transparency.

**Features**  

Forgery Classification – Classifies images as real or forged using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

Visual Explainability – Uses Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to generate heatmaps and localize manipulated regions.

Deepfake Detection – Focused on identifying AI-generated image manipulations, such as DeepFakes.

Digital Forensics Aid – Supports analysts with visual cues on tampered image sections.
